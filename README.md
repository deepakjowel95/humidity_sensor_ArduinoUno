# humidity_sensor_ArduinoUno
# Interfaceing a Humidity sensor(DHT11) with Arduino uno to collet data(humidity,temperature,heatindex)  .
# Instruments/devices required-> Arduino Uno, Humidity sensor(DHT11|DHT22|DHT23), Bread Board, resistor(10kohm) and jumper wire.
# There are different type of humidity sensor available in the market to work with I have mentioned three of those above. Any Humidity sensor of the family of DHT can be utilized   for the projecct. This Project uses DHT11 
# Step.1-> Open Arduino IDE go to 'tools' on the menu toolbar select 'Manage Libraries..' from the pop down list or you can simply press ctrl+alt+I. In the library manager dialoge   box search for 'DHT'. Install 'DHT Sensor Library ' by adafruit from the search results, there are many libraries available but i have used the one by adafruit for this   project.Once you have clicked on install the library manager suggests you the install some necessary utility library, install those too.
